Web Conference
=====================

Web conferencing technologies are not standardized, which has reduced interoperability and transparency and increased platform dependence, security issues, cost and market segmentation. In 2003, the IETF established a working group to establish a standard for web conferencing, called "Centralized Conferencing (xcon)".[6] The planned deliverables of xcon include:

* A binary floor control protocol. Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP)[7] published as RFC 4582
* A mechanism for membership and authorization control
* A mechanism to manipulate and describe media "mixing" or "topology" for multiple media types (audio, video, text)
* A mechanism for notification of conference related events/changes (for example a floor change
